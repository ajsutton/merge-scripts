# Merge Interop Scripts

Contains a bunch of interop scripts for testing various consensus and execution layer clients in different combinations.

Generally it attempts to handle the initial checkout and compilation of clients as well as configuring the testnets and launching
the clients.  This may not always be perfect, but the script gives runnable code that you at least know worked for one person rather than instructions that may have been recorded incorrectly.

Note that most testnets delete themselves and start completely fresh on each run.
